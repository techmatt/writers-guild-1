You have been on this plane for some time, and have come to realize that things are not as wonderful as they might first have appeared. Just like on the elemental plane, the four elements have been in a state of near-constant warfare since arriving. You have astutely realized that these battles are in some ways different here. Among the ways is that they are substantially more destructive. Low and even mid-ranking elementals often sustain serious injury that take months to heal. In rare occasions, elementals have actually died. These deaths rock the entire hierarchy. The amount of fighting has consequently declined substantially as the factions try to work out why the consequences of fighting for dominance on this plane are so extreme.

The only thing that is missing from this plane, that exists on the elemental plane, is the Quintessence. The Quintessence is best described as a fifth element. Rather than wielding one of the four cardinal elements of fire, water, earth and air, the Quintessence is all about maintaining the balance between the elements. It is not entirely clear how they do this, but they do. No elemental faction has ever managed to gain the upper hand against the others, no matter how it tried. Whenever any elemental faction has seemed to make progress, the Quintessence, despite being few in number, have managed to restore order and balance very rapidly.

You feel unsettled on this plane some times. The feeling is becoming more prominent and more frequent. You have begun to wonder in the deepest recesses of your mind whether the Quintessence actually served some purpose other than subverting you and your kind. Because of this uncertainty, the elemental factions have shifted their focus away from outright destruction of the other elements to exerting control over them similar to how the Quintessence controlled the elements on the elemental plane.
