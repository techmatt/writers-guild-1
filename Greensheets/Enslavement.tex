\name{\gEnslave{}} 

You may attempt to enslave humans and elementals of a lower rank than you in your same faction. (Note: If an elemental of a different faction, or an elemental of lower rank within your faction, attempts to enslave you via this ability, simply say ``resist'')

If you would like to enslave someone, incant ``I attempt to enslave you 1'', ``I attempt to enslave you 2'', etc. up to a count of 10. This action is interruptible by anyone except your target (your target cannot interrupt the action). Since this is not a CR based attack, your target cannot resist unless they know otherwise. Your target may however attack you with a CR based attack. If you are able to resist the attack, you may do so and continue your incantation as if you had not been attacked. (If you were at ``I attempt to enslave you 4'' when your target attacked you, you may say ``resist'' and then ``I attempt to enslave you 5'' etc.).

If your target successfully resists, or if you are interrupted by someone else, your attempt immediately fails.

If you successfully enslave your target, they are compelled to do as you ask for 5 minutes. You can compel your target to perform any action that is not a suicide. You can compel ask your target to discuss a given topic. You may {\bf not} compel your target to reveal specific information. (``Tell me about this machine'' is a valid command, ``Tell me exactly what you plan to do with this machine'' is not.)

{\bf Regardless of whether your attempt to enslave someone is successful or not, this ability has a 15 minute cool down before it can be used again.}
