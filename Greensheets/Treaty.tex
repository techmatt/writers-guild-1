Formalizing a human/elemental treaty is a big step toward eventual peace between humans and elementals. Like all such political documents, there is a formal process for creating and signing a treaty.

If you would like to formalize a treaty between humans and an elemental faction, you must follow these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Obtain verbal confirmation from the current leader of the humans, and the current leader of the elemental faction in question that they agree to a treaty.
  \item Compose an introductory paragraph expressing your desires for the treaty.  Write it down.
  \item Obtain a \emph{written} paragraph from the leader of the humans enumerating the commitments that humans offer. (If necessary, transfer it to the same page with your introduction.)
  \item Obtain a \emph{written} paragraph from the leader of the elemental faction enumerating the commitments that the elementals offer. (If necessary, transfer it to the same page with your introduction.)
  \item Once both leaders agree to the terms of the treaty, have both of them sign the treaty at a public ceremony.  The attendees of the ceremony must include at least 3 humans, 2 elementals of the faction signing the treaty, and one elemental from a different faction. (The leaders of the factions count toward their respective race's attendee numbers).*
  \item Sign the treaty yourself (as a diplomat) and obtain the signature of 1 other witness. (There should be 4 signatures on the treaty at this point.) 
  \item At this point, the treaty is complete. Human tradition demands the treaty be displayed to the public, but these are desperate times, and an exception might be made if circumstances warrant it.
\end{enumerate}

Once the treaty has been signed by the leaders at the ceremony, both parties are expected to abide by the terms. Make sure everyone understands this before he or she signs.

*If there are not enough members of a faction left alive to fulfill the requirements, they cannot sign a treaty.
