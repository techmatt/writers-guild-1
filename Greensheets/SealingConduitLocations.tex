In the name of maintaining your advantage on this plane, you intend to prevent anyone from opening the Conduit tonight.  To do this, you will have to seal the possible Conduit locations. This also leads to your ultimate goal of sealing the Conduit permanantly. To seal the Conduit locations, you will need to draw a Rune of Sealing across the location in a mixture of human blood and elemental ``blood.''

To seal a Conduit location:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Acquire a vial of human blood. To do this use your ``\aDrawBlood{}'' ability.
  \item Acquire a vial of elemental ``blood'' from any elemental faction (you \emph{may} acquire the blood from yourself). To do this use your ``\aDrawBlood{}'' ability.
  \item Make a tally mark on each vial when you use the vial to seal a location. {\bf Each pair of vials (one of human blood and one of elemental blood) can be used to create up to 3 seals before they are empty (at which point, destroy the item cards).}
  \item Spend 2 minutes mixing the human and elemental blood and shaping the rune of sealing. Roleplay accordingly.  If anyone asks you what you are doing (ie: ``What do I see?''), explain to them that they see you spreading a dark, sticky substance over this location.
  \item Place a ``\wSealedConduit{}'' whitesheet over the Conduit location to indicate that it has been sealed.
\end{enumerate}

Unfortunately, this seal is not permanent until it sets and the mixture will not set for several days. Until then, someone could wash your seal off. You will have to keep an eye on it.

{\large \emph{If 8 possible locations are sealed at the end of game, the Conduit will be sealed permanently and can never be opened again.}}
