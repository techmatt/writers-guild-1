\name{\gLockedDoorAccess{}}%%This info is now partof the sign on the door and SHOULD NOT prod.

There are two ways to pass this door:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Possess the appropriate key (item number: \iLabKey{\MYnumber}).
 \item You may hit the door with a {\bf CR of 10} or greater. If you choose to do so, you must write ``Broken'' on the sign indicating that the door is unlocked. Anyone may now freely pass into the room since the door has been broken down. {\bf Further,} elementals that participate in breaking the door down must write their elemental type on the back of this sheet since this action leaves elemental residue on the door. Anyone possessing a \iTricorder{} with ``Detect Elemental Residue'' functionality may look under the sheet to learn the type(s) of elementals that participated in breaking the door down.
\end{enumerate}
