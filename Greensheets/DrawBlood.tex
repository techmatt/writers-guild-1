This greensheet explains how to draw blood from someone.

In order to draw blood:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Acquire ``\iVial{}'' and ``\iSyringe{}''. 
\item Take 30 seconds to draw blood from a {\bf willing or helpless target (restrained or unconscious)}. You may also take up to 2 vials of blood from a wounded person. (The person takes no CR penalty). You may not take blood from a dead player - their life essence is gone and the blood is useless to you.
\item Write on the vial card that it contains human or elemental blood and from what faction (for elementals). 
\end{enumerate}

NOTE: When you draw blood from someone, the person takes a -1 to CR for 3 minutes. {\bf You must tell your target their CR loss.} You may not draw blood from the same person more than once every 10 minutes.  The CR of a player cannot drop below 1 from this ability.
