\name{\gConduitModifier{}}

All Conduit-modifying abilities should be placed on this sheet. They are publicly visible for everyone to read, even people not participating in opening the Conduit (the actions being performed are obvious). The ``\aWorkConduit{}'' ability must always be present. Each player can have only one ability present.
