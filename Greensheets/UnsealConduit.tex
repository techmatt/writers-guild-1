\name{\gUnsealConduit{}} 

As a low ranking elemental, you have spent much of your life running around, cleaning things up at the bidding of higher ranking elementals. You are therefore well versed in how to clean almost anything off of almost any surface. In particular, you are familiar with a method for cleaning off compounds used to seal things. 

If you would like to clean a seal off of a possible conduit location, you must: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Acquire a \iBowl{} (Item number: \iBowl{\MYnumber{}}), and fill it with water from the pond (This will take you 2 minutes), 
\item Acquire a bottle of \iLye{} (Item number: \iLye{\MYnumber{}}.). \emph{These items will come to a total of 3 hands bulky, so you will either need help or you will need to  walk heel to toe to your location.} 
\item Then spend 3 minutes cleaning the seal off. Role play accordingly.
\end{enumerate}
