\begin{page}{first}
You have observed humans for a long time, but have only recently begun talking to a few of the scientists and politicians.  You think it would be useful to use this meeting as an opportunity to learn more about humans.  At game start, you may  turn to \nbref{second}.
\end{page}

\begin{page}{second}
You know that \cJuliet{} has been Fire's liason to humans.  (You wonder if she has discovered anything about them you haven't.  So go talk to her!) When you have done this, turn to \nbref{third}.
\end {page}

\begin{page}{third}
 That is interesting.  You have heard \cDiplomat{} mention the terms "Azi" and "Cit" before, but you are not entirely sure what they mean- you think there might be different kinds of humans?  Spend at least five minutes talking to \cDiplomat{} about this distinction. Also, find out which of the humans present fit into which category (and maybe make a list?).  When you have done this, turn to \nbref{fourth}.
\end{page}

\begin{page}{fourth}
Perhaps (you should talk to MOAR humans!  Including at least 1 other Azi and 1 Cit.  The Cit might be GD).
\end{page}

\begin{page}{fifth}
 That certainly did give you some interesting insights into human society and behaviors, but you still wonder about their physiology.  Elementals seem to be able to sustain their power and energy for very long periods of time, but humans seem to need to ingest items in order to renew their energy.  You aren't entirely sure what humans eat, though.  Perhaps you can locate some items and see if the humans will eat them?  (maybe they run on the same stuff the science tools do!  feed them a wire or a screw or something in the lab, and humans don't want to eat it!!!) 
 turn to \nbref{sixth}.
\end{page}


\begin{page}{sixth}
 Well, that didn't seem to work.  It seems that there are only certain kinds of items that humans can ingest as food.  Perhaps you can find some food items in the kitchen?  You know the kitchen is currently being used as HQ for Fire, but perhaps you can convince \cJuliet {} to let you in?  Once you are in the kitchen, turn to \nbref {seventh}
\end{page}

\begin{page}{seventh}
(Yay!  Gather 3 food items and convince 3 different humans to eat them.  Observe if the humans have gained more energy as a result.)

\begin{page}{final}
(Yay you win and the humans are feeling more energetic!  Get a cool social ability that might be good for peacekeeping! )
\end{page}
