\name{\cJuliet{}}

You are in love.  That's what it has to be, for you to take such risks to see \cRomeo{\intro} as often as you can.  After all, \cRomeo{\they} is a human soldier (bodyguard to the human President, no less!), and you're the Fire elemental sent to spy on the humans.  If any of your fellow elementals found out that you're in a \emph{relationship} with a \emph{human}...well, you'd rather not think about what would happen.  At best, an unbreakable command from Queen \cQueen{\intro} never to see \cRomeo{} again.  At worst, \cRomeo{\they} would be incinerated for daring to think \cRomeo{\themselves} worthy of an elemental's love.  Not being very high up in the Fire hierarchy, you'd be powerless to prevent the execution.  Actually, the only reason you are provisionally a rank B elemental is that the Queen needed an agent to observe the humans and find out why all elementals seem to be losing power, and your cousin \cPyro{\intro} recommended you.  What an honor it was, how happy you were, meeting the Queen and receiving this temporary promotion!  You swore to \cQueen{\them} and to \cPyro{} that you would not let them down, and at first everything seemed to go well.

To have an excuse to meet humans, you began acting as an intermediary between Queen \cQueen{} and the King of the Air elementals, \cKing{\intro}, who of the four elemental factions has the closest ties to humans.  In this diplomatic capacity, you are introduced to President \cLeader{\intro}, leader of the remaining humans, who seems rather desperate to form some peace treaty, \emph{any} peace treaty, with any elemental faction to keep \cLeader{\their} people alive.  Queen \cQueen{} isn't particuarly interested in a permanent alliance with humans, especially since \cQueen{\they} is secretly planning to open the Conduit and bring over more Fire elementals from the elemental plane, but it's useful to dangle the possibility of a treaty in front of \cLeader{\them}.  

In the beginning, you thought that humans were such simple, boring creatures.  Flatter them a little, slip them a tiny nugget of useless information about elementals, imply that you trusted them and would prefer to deal with \emph{them} alone, and all of a sudden they thought you were their best elemental friend who would keep the other marauding elementals from squashing or incinerating them.  Where was the fun in manipulating such gullible fools?

But the more you associated with humans, the more you realized that they were actually wily creatures, no less deceitful and scheming than any elemental.  They all had different personalities, once you got to know them.  After a while, they even started to look different!  President \cLeader{}, far from the political naif you originally thought \cLeader{\them}, is certainly a worthy opponent.  Every time you try to find out what \cLeader{\they} knows about the loss of elemental power, \cLeader{\they} drops vague hints about \cLeader{\their} scientists conducting critical research and being on the verge of breakthroughs.  \cLeader{\They}'d be \emph{happy} to share the results with \cLeader{\their} friends, of course.  And then \cLeader{\they}'d start expounding on the benefits of a human-elemental alliance.

Of course, you expanded your circle of human contacts to see if you could pry information out of someone else.  And that was when you became acquainted with \cRomeo{}.  As \cLeader{}'s bodyguard, \cRomeo{\they} presented a logical target since \cRomeo{\they} has access to the President's rooms and documents.  By this time, you knew enough about human society to understand the Cit/azi distinction.  It is clear that \cRomeo{\they} was programmed to guard \cLeader{}'s interests and that \cRomeo{\they} also shares \cRomeo{\their} handler's commitment to preserving the human race.  Given this incorruptibility, the usual appeal to greed or ambition wouldn't work, so you decided to befriend \cRomeo{\them} instead...and that's when things went wrong, because to your utter shock you found yourself falling love with \cRomeo{\them}.

Now you find yourself caught between your love and your duty.  \cRomeo{} would be furious if \cRomeo{\they} knew about \cQueen{}'s plan to bring over more Fire elementals (especially since the ones here already aren't always careful about what they burn), but you happen to agree with that plan. You genuinely believe that there is too much chaos in this world, and that if only Fire could be allowed to rule, it could impose the proper hierarchy and bring peace.  And yet, you don't want to do anything that would cause \cRomeo{} to break up with you, as \cRomeo{\they} certainly would if too many humans get killed.  As it is, your relationship is already tense because there was an unfortunate incident involving an elemental destroying a plane and the Air faction is blaming you for it.  You know you didn't do it, but \cRomeo{} suspects you're lying to \cRomeo{\them}.  Complicating matters yet more, now is not the time to anger the King \cKing{} by denying the accusations too hotly, because the Queen has just commanded you to find out what \cKing{\they} knows of Water faction plots.  

Just to make your life even more difficult, you have to make sure that as few people as possible find out about your relationship with \cRomeo{}.  It goes without saying that you can't let the Queen find out, but most of the other elementals, regardless of faction, would also see you as a traitor.  \cPyro{}, as your overprotective cousin, would certainly nag you to end the relationship as soon as possible for your own good (although you know that \cPyro{\they} was working very closely with a human scientist \cMS{\intro} and may have been involved in research to enable azi to enslave elementals...so you could probably ``persuade'' \cPyro{\them} to leave you alone).  You \emph{have} received much-appreciated encouragement from the human azi diplomat \cDiplomat{\intro}, who thinks that your love story will do wonders for human-elemental relations.  President \cLeader{} is also sympathetic, though of course you know you can't trust \cLeader{\them} not to blackmail you.

All in all, life is complicated, and you hope that this meeting won't make things even worse!
