You are \cMiniEarth{\intro}, one of the most powerful air elementals in existence! Even the greatest fire is extinguished by your breath, and you can circle the entirety of this tiny planet in the blink of an eye! When angered, you embody storms that could level even the tallest mountain!

Okay so maybe you're not quite so powerful just yet. In fact you're only a few decades old. But that doesn't matter. One day you will be the equal of all but your hero \cKing{\intro}, the king of the air elementals. \cKing{\They} is really awesome.

You've spent most of your time learning to fly, but you're a big elemental now and \emph{of course} you know how to fly perfectly only little kids don't know how to fly and you are definitely a grown up now. You also know that \cKing{} is legendary for \cKing{\their} diversity of skills and unending capability to cause mischief and never focus on any one thing for any amount of time. You are trying \emph{very hard} to be as cool as \cKing{} and towards that end you are always trying to prove that you are just as capable of embodying the creativity, speed, and diversity of the air.

Your greatest talent is music. Every hole in a mountain, every half-filled bottle, every leaf-filled tree is your instrument. You absolutely love any form of musical expression, but especially singing. You can perfectly learn any song you hear and are very proud of this skill. You try to accumulate as many songs as you can. Elementals have the coolest songs, of course. But these humans aren't too bad either. At least they use air to sing, you can definitely relate to that.

This morning the best thing happened! \cKing{} was about to head out on some very important mission. But as he left (along with his advisor \cNaturalist{}) he stopped to look around. As his gaze fell over his many subjects, they landed on none other than you! He wanted \emph{you} to accompany him! This is the most amazing thing that has ever happened to you and you are still recovering from this.

You were quickly wisked away to some place where humans live. You haven't the slightest idea what is going on here and \cKing{} is way faster than you so you haven't exactly had a chance to talk to him, but once you landed you did find that there are a lot of other elementals from the other factions here. That's when you realized this is a very serious meeting, because elementals \emph{do not} just gather like this for no reason. And there are humans here too.

You don't know what's going on. You don't know why you're here. You do know, however, that these people probably know lots of songs! And you don't usually get to meet any elementals besides air elementals, so you are very, very excited about learning their songs. You've already found a water elemental called \cMiniWater{\intro} who taught you a cool song. In fact, this is not just any song but a pretty special song that can attract water elementals. You kind of like this \cMiniWater{} fellow as \cMiniWater{\they}'s the only one here close to your age. \cMiniWater{\They} apparently wants to sing this song while something called the Conduit is open. You aren't sure exactly what this might do, but you are positive it will cause a lot of mischief, and that is \emph{absolutely} something you (and any self-respeting air elemental) fully support.

You think it is awesome \cKing{} chose you to come here, but you are still pretty intimidated by him and maybe just slightly shy. You don't want to distract him too much if you can help it. You think it will be much more interesting to go around and pester the other factions of elementals and humans to figure out exactly what everyone is doing here. And learning songs, of course.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item  Learn as many songs as you can.
	\item  Cause the ultimate mischief by working with \cMiniWater{} to sing Water's Song into the Conduit.
	\item  Cause other, less-ultimate mischief as appropriate.
	\item  Avoid disturbing \cKing{} too much.
	\item  Figure out what on earth everyone is doing here.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cKing{\intro}} Your hero, the king of the air elementals!
	\contact{\cNaturalist{\intro}} Advisor to \cKing{}. \cNaturalist{\They}'s very old, and except for \cKing{} old people are well, old.
	\contact{\cMiniWater{\intro}} A water elemental your age who seems to be alone.
\end{contacts}
