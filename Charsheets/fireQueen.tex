You love this new world.  Even after a hundred years, it continues to amaze you by the opportunities it presents - such different terrains, ranging from the desolate ice plains and endless desserts to golden prairies and lush green forests.  And, oh, so many volcanoes to occupy and turn into palaces!  Without any interference from those pesky Quintessence creatures, you are now free to realize your full potential - as soon as you conquer this entire planet with the Fire elemental army you intend to create.  Every once in a while, the elemental plane and earth are aligned closely enough to open a Conduit between them.  Even though you have publicly proclaimed that you would like to open it in order to bring over elementals of all factions, you have no intention of actually doing so.  Instead, you're planning to pull over as many Fire elementals as possible so you can wipe out the other factions!  Then the whole earth will be yours!

The pre-existing inhabitants, those creatures calling themselves ``humans'' who brought you over from the elemental plane in the first place and then regretted it, still present the occasional annoyance but thankfully their numbers are much diminished now.  Much of the credit for this housekeeping goes to your subordinate \cPyro{\intro}, who is convinced that the Fire elementals should conquer the entire earth, and who is zealous in removing humans who get in the way.  For example, when you first established yourself in your primary volcanic home, there were still humans living in settlements of ugly squarish structures nearby.  They quite spoiled the view.  \cPyro{} was the one who suggested burning them out using lava from the volcano.  Once you approved the plan, \cPyro{\they} carried it out beautifully, pouring tons of lava and fire upon the settlement.  The humans haven't returned since to bother you.

However, you are concerned that they are adapting to the elemental presence on earth and that they will ally with one of the other factions, Water, Air, or Earth, to strengthen it.  Right now, all four elemental factions are vying for power.  Earth presents the least immediate threat, because its King is seriously ill and his two deputies disagree with each other.  Actually, some rumors are circulating that he is dying, which would weaken that faction even more.  However, you've noticed that your own powers have gradually been decreasing - you are not as powerful as you were a hundred years ago.  This may be because you are tired from creating Fire elementals to serve you, but you suspect that there is more to it.  You worry that the Earth King's illness is related to your own waning powers.  That, of course, is a longer term problem.

The second greatest immediate threat is Water, your old enemy, which has ensconced itself quite firmly in the many oceans (as soon as you take over the earth, you're going to boil them all away).  You haven't seen the Water Queen for some time now, so you're certain she is plotting against you.  Maybe she intends to inundate some of your volcanic islands with tsunamis.  Or maybe it's worse.  You can send your spy, \cJuliet{\intro}, to gather intelligence.  \cJuliet{\They} is a relatively weak Fire elemental recommended to you by \cPyro{}, who is quite fond of \cJuliet{\them}.  You promoted her and gave her extra powers on a provisional basis, and so far \cJuliet{\they} has proven useful.  If \cJuliet{\they} continues to be successful, you plan to make \cJuliet{\their} promotion permanent and put \cJuliet{\their} in charge of training more intelligence operatives.

As you see it, Air is the greatest threat to your ascendance.  Being silly and fickle, Air alternately considers humans to be amusing pets or potential allies.  Right now their king, \cKing{\intro}, is toying with the idea of an alliance with them and frequently meets with their leader, \cLeader{\intro}.  \cJuliet{} has been very useful in gathering information about their negotiations.  Apparently the humans claim that they have been researching the decline in elemental power and have found a cure.  So far they have been deliberately vague, using it as bait.  \cLeader{} seems pretty desperate to sign a peace treaty with as many elemental factions as possible (because somehow \cLeader{\they} thinks a piece of paper would keep you from incinerating inconvenient humans?).  You remain suspicious of \cLeader{\their} claims, but if \cLeader{\they} is correct, this knowledge will give whichever faction allies with the humans an edge over the other factions.  It may even tip the balance.  You're not convinced that you want to ally with them (can't you just take their knowledge and incinerate anyone who stands in your way?), but you definitely want to prevent an alliance between Air and the humans.

You have been receiving information about humans and their research from another source as well: the humans' second-in-command, \cDema{\intro}, who wants to become supreme leader of the humans.  You see in \cDema{\them} a kindred spirit and have grudging respect for \cDema{\their} ambition.  Of course, you are perfectly aware that you cannot trust everything \cDema{\they} says, but according to \cDema{\them}, the humans have been developing potent technology that is harmful to elementals.  \cDema{\They} volunteered this warning in hopes of winning your support for \cDema{\their} power bid, which does lend credence to it.  You need to find out more about this report before you decide on a course of action. 

In an interesting twist, your spy \cJuliet{} appears to have fallen in love with one of the humans, \cRomeo{\intro}, bodyguard of \cLeader{}.  This is intriguing and may prove useful at some point.  No one else knows that you suspect their relationship, and you're keeping this bit of intelligence to yourself for now.  After all, knowledge is power, and power is what you want!
