You are \cMS{\intro}, the best scientist humanity has. Barring some sect of underground academics who have managed to keep themselves hidden these past few decades, you are also the only person with the capability and vision to keep humanity from either being destroyed or enslaved by the elementals. People may call you mad, and yes, you do occasionally get caught up in your work, but as far as you know, you seem to be the only one sane enough to see what the elementals are doing. The politicians espouse a viewpoint of ``caution'' and ``balance'' and the elementals do indeed seem to be keeping each other in check, but the equilibrium is so absurdly unstable you can't help but cackle a bit when you think about it.

%the mad scientist knows they are brilliant; so the paragraph below will just boldly state their ``best guess'' which, it turns out, is usually correct.

It is plain as day what the motives of the elementals are: \cQueen{\intro}, the queen of the fire elementals, is infuriated she cannot get the upper hand on her rivals, and is at the Conduit because she believes she can bring through more of her kind to help wipe out the other elemental factions. Meanwhile, \cKing{\intro}, the king of the air elementals, believes the balance is already tipping in his faction's favor. He aims to leverage his friendship with the humans to further shift the battlefield while preventing \cQueen{} from bringing through allies of any sort. The king of the earth elementals is supposedly sick; obviously, he was poisoned by his rivals -- you'd assume \cKing{} although you honestly haven't had enough time to look into the matter (your certain you could find out exactly which rival if you actually cared to do so). Finally, the queen of the water elementals is quite aware that the elemental leaders here are practically certain to murder each other by day's end and is wisely staying as far away as possible. You may not know every little detail, but you don't have to because the general summary is clear as day: the elementals are at war and unless you do something they will rip the Earth apart to kill each other and humanity will be crushed in the ensuing conflict.

Unfortunately for the elementals, they are sorely underestimating humans. You know what they are up to, you know how they work, and you can use that knowledge to stop them. You have spent your entire career studying the elementals and are (by a considerable margin) the world's expert on the elemental's pseudo-psionic capabilities. To you, their capacity to enslave each other and humans is simultaneously a terrifying and thrillingly power. It is an immensely complex process, but, it turns out, not one so complex you are incapable of understanding and controlling it. 

Unfortunately, your research is held back not by your intellect but by the dangers of conducting experiments. To gather useful data, you require elemental test subjects. You briefly explored the idea of appealing to militaristic types like \cDema{\intro}, the secretary of state. However you ultimately found that this type of research was labeled ``too dangerous'' or ``too politically unstable'' to pursue. Realizing how serious the situation is, you have continued to pursue your research in secret, but progress is painfully slow -- although you suspect that is about to change as the volatility of the situation at the Conduit site will afford many situations where you will be able to make \emph{immense} progress in your work.

Your plan is to create a device capable of replicating the elemental's enslavement ability, mass produce it, and use it to tear the elemental factions apart from the inside. Unfortunately, you are far from the mass production stage -- you have only a single prototype and it both constantly malfunctioning and despite your ceaseless efforts only able to enslave the weakest of elementals. A year ago, however, while studying exactly how Azi are able to largely resist the elemental's psionics, you came to a breakthrough that has revolutionized your work. Azi, it turns out, are not just resistant to enslavement but also a perfect conduit for replicating and controlling psionic powers. Empowered with this new insight, you spent months developing a new Azi tape, the audio-visual stimuli used to train Azi. This tape enables the retaped Azi to mimic the enslavement power of even the most powerful elementals, rivaling even their kings and queens. You can't exactly gain enough data to be certain, but you suspect that with enough retaped Azi working together, you could even gain control one of the elemental leaders.

Unfortunately, illegally retaping Azi is a crime comparable to kidnapping or murder. Despite this, you felt it was absolutely necessary for you to test your tape on a real elemental. Towards that end, you
