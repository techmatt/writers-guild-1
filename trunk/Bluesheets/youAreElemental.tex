{\bf History:}
Everyone knows the history of elementals on this human plane. One hundred years ago, a a human somehow managed to open the conduit and pull through 4 mid-level elementals, one of each of the cardinal elements fire, water, earth and air. These elementals quickly expanded over the earth by aliquoting their power into minions. As on the elemental plane, there is no love lost between the factions and infighting reigns supreme. Each faction is always trying to one-up the others and gain mastery over the whole world.

{\bf The Conduit}
The conduit is the weakest point between the human and elemental plane. Once every 10 years or so, the planes come into close proximity with each other. Every 100 years or so, the planes come particularly close, and it is therefore particularly easy to open the conduit between the planes. That time is now. The planes will be most aligned right at midnight. The last time the conduit was opened was 100 years ago when the first elementals were brought over.

{\bf The Suppressor Field}
As a general rule, elementals do not like to be near the conduit because it has a damper field of some kind. For reasons unclear, even the strongest elementals on this plane cannot wield their powers with impunity in the field. Powers are so dampened in fact, that nan elemental and a human might be nearly equally matched in fighting prowess.

{\emph The suppressor field extends over all of game space.}

{\bf The Elemental Council:}
Once very 5 years, the elements hold a council. For one night only, the factions put aside their squabbling and come together to discuss issues that affect them all. Normally the council is held on an island in the middle of the pacific ocean, as far away from humans as possible, but since the two planes are so close together tonight, the conduit has been selected as the location, despite the suppressor field.

{\bf The Hierarchy:}
One of the most important aspects of elemental culture is the hierarchy. Lower rank elementals must defer to higher rank elementals of their faction. The King or Queen is the highest ranking element of the faction on this plane at rank A. Most factions have three or four ranks under the King or Queen. It is not immediately obvious what rank an elemental is, but becomes apparent with minimal observation of the extent of their powers. Since the suppressor field dampens all elemental power, it will be harder than usual to determine the rank of an elemental. Although it is rarely necessary, an elemental of higher rank can compel a lower ranking elemental of the same element to do some task.

The hierarchy is more than just a social formality though. Since all lower ranking elements are spawned from the Kings and Queens, their survival is tied to that of their leader. If the leader of an elemental faction where to die, all of the other elementals of htat faction would be crippled.

{\emph {If the leader of an elemental faction dies, all other elementals of that faction take a permenant -2 penelty on their CR. 

{\bf Enslaving Humans:}
Elementals also have the ability to compel humans to some extent. This is not common practice because it is rare that elementals find some use for humans. Enslavement is a long and tedious process and doesn't last for very long; it is rarely worth it. It does potentially have it's uses however, particularly to tip the balance between elemental factions.
