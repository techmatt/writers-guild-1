{\b{History}}
Everyone knows the history of elementals on this human plane. One hundred years ago, a a human somehow managed to open the conduit and pull through 4 mid-level elementals, one of each of the cardinal elements fire, water, earth and air. These elementals quickly expanded over the earth by aliquoting their power into minions. As on the elemental plane, there is no love lost between the factions and infighting reigns supreme. Each faction is always trying to one-up the others and gain mastery over the whole world.

{\b{The Conduit}}
The conduit is the weakest point between the human and elemental plane. Once every 10 years or so, the planes come into close proximity with each other. Every 100 years or so, the planes come particularly close, and it is particularly easy to open the conduit between the planes. That time is now. The planes will be most aligned right at midnight. The last time the conduit was opened was 100 years ago when the first elementals were brought over.

As a general rule, elementals do not like to be near the conduit because it has a damper field of some kind. FOr reasons unclear

{\b{The Elemental Concil}}
Once very 5 years, the elements hold a council. For one night only, the factions put aside their squabbling nad come together to discuss issues that affect them all. Normally the

The King or Queen is the highest ranking element of the faction on this plane at rank A. Most factions have three or four ranks under the King or Queen. It is not immediately obvious what rank an elemental is, but becomes apparent with minimal observation of the extent of their powers.
