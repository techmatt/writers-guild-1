This bluesheet enumerates the relevant parts of the collective history of the human race. This information is common knowledge to most humans.

{\bf Azi:} %%What is "`tape"' exactly? I don't remember, I will ask at the meeting and correct it in this file
Several hundred years ago, humans developed technologies that allowed them to raise humans in almost completely controlled environments. Through years of extensive psycho-sensory training, these humans could be trained as experts in just about anything, as long as the training material had been written. Azi make wonderful soldiers, mechanics and scientists, as long as the tasks presented to them require minimal innovation. Creativity is a skill that has so far eluded writers of Azi training programs. The training instills in the Azi a strict sense of duty to their supervisor. They will do most things asked of them by their supervisor as long as it does not conflict with their basic taping.

Having a class of humans that are extremely good at what they are trained to do, and unlikely to question most orders, is of course a temptation for some Cits (``citizens''. ie: non-Azi humans). There are a few dark souls who might wish to usurp Azi for their own ends. Every now and then, stories surface of Azi who have been re-taped too quickly.  Taping is a process designed to take weeks or months. There is no safe way to re-tape an Azi in a shorter span of time. It can be done, but at a terrible price. The Azi is rarely able to recover, and may be non-functional for the rest of their lives.  The legal consequences for re-taping an Azi too rapidly are substantial. %%The leader _could_ authorize it in an emergency.

{\bf Elementals:}
One hundred years ago, the world was changed forever when \cGrandfather{}, in a foolish attempt to make super soldiers, somehow managed to summon hugely powerful elementals - one each of fire, water, earth and air. No one knows where they came from, only that they are wreaking havoc across the world. 

While not everyone accuses \cGrandfather{} of having caused this disaster on purpose, all looked to him to fix it. He quickly started work again, and those close to him claim that he was even making progress. But one night, less than a month after the original disaster, a group of Azi broke into \cGrandfather{\their} lab, destroyed all of \cGrandfather{\their} research, and killed \cGrandfather{\them}. The police investigation that followed determined that the Azi that perpetrated the crime had been brutally re-taped. The psychologists determined that the re-taping process could not have taken more than a few hours. Unfortunately for the investigation, while most the Azi were apprehended within a few days, they were all deemed completely insane, and most committed suicide within a week despite being under close surveillance. Whoever was the mastermind behind this crime was never brought to justice.

Literally hundreds of thousands of people have died since the elementals were created. It is not clear that the elementals have even noticed. Humanity has long sought a way to fight back, but to no avail. It doesn't matter whether the elemental is fire, water, earth or air, humans die when they get too close. For the strongest elementals, ``close'' could be within 100 meters. Some of the weakest elementals, which the strongest elementals seem to create with impunity, do not passively . There is a theory that if an elemental where to bother caring about humans, they would be able to touch a human without destroying them, or even protect them from other elementals. \cDiplomat{} is testing this theory, and so far is still alive, so perhaps it has some merit. It all relies on the continued goodwill of the elementals however, and that makes many people understandably nervous.

One particularly disturbing phenomenon involving elementals is that of mind control. It has recently come to light that some elementals are taking an interest in humans in a bad way. They are apparently inducing some form of mind control, that can compel humans to do things against their will. To compound the problem, the phenomenon often leaves the human with amnesia, and so their actions can only be pieced together from the accounts of bystanders.

Within the last 10 years or so, a new movement has emerged among the humans. This movement argues that humanity should seek not to fight the elementals but to ally with them. \cLeader{}, the leader of the new united nations, and the high ranking diplomat, \cAvatar{}, have been championing the cause. \cAirKing{} seems to be willing to entertain the possibility of peace, and \cLeader{} and \cAvatar{} are moving forward with the process. Some people are wary of his sudden good will, others say not to look a gift horse in the mouth. Regardless, \cLeader{} has secured an invitation to an elemental council tonight. It is the first time humans will be able to interact with elementals in some meaningful way. The world waits with bated breath for a positive outcome.
