  \s\MYeffect	{You can draw blood from a target player if you have a vial (item number: \iVial{\MYnumber{}}) and a syringe (item number: \iSyringe{\MYnumber{}}). This action takes 30 seconds. Write on the vial card that it contains human or elemental blood and from what faction (for elementals). The first time you draw blood from someone, the person takes a -1 to CR for 3 minutes. The second time you draw blood, they suffer a -2 to CR, etc. {\bf You must tell your target their CR loss.} Note: the CR of a player cannot drop below 1 from this ability.)

You are therefore well versed in how to clean almost anything off of almost any surface. In particular, you are familiar with a method for cleaning off compounds used to seal things. If you would like to clean a seal off of a possible conduit location, you will need some help. You will need to acquire a \iBowl{} (Item number: \iBowl{\MYnumber{}}), and fill it with water from the pond (This will take you 2 minutes), and a bottle of \iLye{} (Item number: \iLye{\MYnumber{}}. It is a caustic chemical). \emph{These items will come to a total of 3 hands bulky, so you will either need help or you will need to  walk heel to toe to your location.} Then spend 3 minutes cleaning the seal off. Role play accordingly.
