\begin{page}{first}

This white powder you've found is very interesting, you need to do considerably more analysis. This would be so much easier if you were at a real lab instead of this hodge-podge of a ``mobile lab'', but you'll make do. Your portable spectrometer is okay, but you remember that \cGD{} has brought a high-resolution mass spectrometer. Ask her to let you borrow it and spend one minute getting her to helping you use it on your sample.

When you complete this step, you may turn to \nbref{second}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{second}

Hmm...you still don't know what this substance does, but it definitely contains particles involved in some very complicated parts of the elemental biological cycles. Use your tricorder to examine elementals from two different factions, spending at least one minute examining each.

When you complete this step, you may turn to \nbref{third}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{third}

This powder is definitely integral to their biochemistry, but there are so many elementals here it's hard to get a great signal. To get a good baseline, ask \cGD{} if you can borrow her Chair of Science, then spend 30 seconds using your tricorder to examining two random humans.

When you complete this step, you may turn to \nbref{fourth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{fourth}

You've learned all you can from the sample passively; time for some active testing. Convince an elemental to taste the powder while you examine them with your tricorder. Once they do so, hand them your ``W packet'' and tell them to open it.

When you complete this step, you may turn to \nbref{five}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{five}

Amazing...the elemental's energy levels jumped dramatically upon consuming the powder, although there is so little of the substance that it is rapidly decaying back to its original level. You don't have a concrete hypothesis yet, but you believe this substance to be a necessary part of the elemental ``diet'' that is likely present on the elemental planes, but missing here on Earth. For ease of reference and because you are enamored with the name, you've started to refer to the substance as ``Elementium''.

To continue your experiments you will need to find a more stable sample of Elementium. Based on your research thus far, you believe you could make a device that would let you extract \emph{elemental essence} from an elemental. To do so, you will need to find an aluminum rod and a 900-mV battery, then use these items on an elemental seated in the Chair of Science. There may be other ways to find elemental essence.

Once you have elemental essence (from any faction of elementals) you can spend one minute using your transmogrifier to turn it into Elementium. \emph{Destroy the essence and take one Elementium item from the transmogrifier}.

When you have any Elementium, you may turn to \nbref{six}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{six}

\emph{From now on, you now may continue to use the Chair of Science to extract essence from elementals or transmogrify elemental essence into Elementium.}

Excellent -- you now realize that your original sample of the substance had been decaying for many years, but this new sample of Elementium is both fresh and much larger. Unfortunately, for some reason it seems to be inert. Find another scientist and collaborate with them for three minutes while you discuss your experiences with Elementium to see if they have any insights into the problem.

When you have finished collaborating, you may turn to \nbref{seven}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{seven}

Ouch! Distracted by the discussion, as you were dividing the substance up into you accidentally cut yourself on the scalpel. A few drops of your blood touched the substance. Initially, you were upset about the obvious contamination this caused, but you were soon shocked to see that the Elementium is no longer inert and is in fact now radiating vibrantly across the spectrum, emitting a soothing white glow. Time to gather more data!

Convince elementals from two different factions to try eating the now-activated Elementium while you scan them. Once they do so, hand them one of your ``X packets'' and tell them to open it.

\emph{Eating Elementium consumes the item, so you will need to get another sample from somewhere. An elemental cannot eat Elementium you have transmogrified from its own essence.}

When you have examined elementals from two different factions eating Elementium, you may turn to \nbref{eight}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{eight}

You are very close to understanding the mysterious chemistry of Elementium, but you need one more thing: to test exposing the substance directly to the elemental planes. To accomplish this, you will need to participate in an opening of the Conduit, no easy feat.

During any opening of the Conduit, you may put a sample of Elementium on the cart. The Elementium must be on the cart for the entire duration of the opening, while you periodically scan it and the surrounding area with your tricorder. Once the Conduit opening is completed, take the Elementium sample back to \cGD{}'s mass spectrometer for analysis then turn to \nbref{nine}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{nine}

Based on your analysis, you have come up with a very self-consistent theory regarding Elementium. It is a compound created by a fifth type of elemental who presumably live on the elemental planes. Without it, the elementals will die once their internal supply is deleted -- your rapid estimate suggests the elementals on Earth have about 50 years before they will all die out unless they find a source of Elementium. It also seems as if elementals who consume this substance will eventually become dependent on whoever is supplying it to them: on the elemental planes, that would be this unknown fifth faction of elementals, but in your experiments today, that would be you.

You are also confident it is possible to extract large quantities of Elementium from strong natural energy sources such as volcanoes or earthquakes. However, you are not sure there is any way to ``activate'' the substance without human blood. Your preliminary analysis shows the effects are similar to drug addiction in humans, and the effect will likely become more pronounced with prolonged exposure to the ``artificial Elementium''.

Inform \cDiplomat{} at once and discuss the ethical ramifications of this discovery. You also feel the need to discuss this with a few of the elementals you have been interacting with to see where they stand.

Gain social ability?
