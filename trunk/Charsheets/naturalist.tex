For as long as you can remember, you have been curious.  Curious about the wind patterns on which you float, curious about the lives of other elementals, curious about this strange world in which you were born, and curious about the elemental plane in which you should have existed.  For nearly a century, you have travelled the world and seen its wonders, and yet there is still more to see and know.  Of course, being an air elemental does give you some advantages in being able to move around the world; you can float where the wind takes you, and the wind will invariable take you where you want to go.  You had seen so much of the human world that you were the natural first choice of your King, \cairKing{\intro} when he needed someone to assist him learn more about humans.  For some time, you had watched them from afar, unsure of whether your interference would harm them, but when your King asked you to speak to them, you delighted in the opportunity.

%%paragraph about previous research but things you still don't know, will have a better idea when I am thinking about the research notebook.  

Of the humans, the scientists always seemed to be the most willing to talk to you.  You learned that some of them are even studying elementals, and were as interested in learning about you as you were in learning about them.  That is how you found out about \cgrandDaughter{\intro}.  \cgrandDaughter{\Their} grandfather had researched the elemental plane, and it was his experiment that had brought the first group of elementals (including your King!) into the human world.  

%%whether gd and nat knew each other previously or nat learned this all through hearsay is still being decided... to be continued.  This will inform the Naturalist's goals about the conduit.

Of course, your studies have not always gone perfectly.  Recently, you were en route to report back to your King, when you saw two large metal birds in the air.  You decided to have a closer look.  They seemed not to be birds, but large, winged metal tubes, which had windows through which you could see human faces.  You paused for a moment, marveling at how these tiny, mundane humans had been able to nevertheless build a flying machine.  You watched the machines soar through the clear sky for a moment, and began to wonder if these human contraptions were carried by the winds in the same way Air elementals were.  You began to manipulate the air currents, and watched the planes smoothly move up and down, side to side, for a time not noticing the look of panic that was overtaking the human faces inside.  It was only when you managed to make one machine roll over to see if it could fly upside-down that you realized you were taking things too far.  However, startled by your own realization that you might be hurting the little humans inside, you breifly stopped paying attention to what you were doing with the wind, and the two flying machines collided with a mighty explosion before hurtling into the ocean below.  You fled the scene in a panic and confessed all to \cairKing{}.  \airKing {They} at first did not understand why you were so upset, but eventually \airKing{they} came to see that if the human leader found out you had crashed the airplanes, the air elemetals would be unlikely to be able to pursue a treaty and make peace with the humans.  \cairKing{} suggested you blame a low-ranking fire elemental.  There were enough flames in the crash, and Fire is responisible for a great deal of destruction of human buildings, it seemed plausible.  You knew that \cJuliet{intro} was travelling a similar route that day, and could have easily come across the flying machines.

For now, you are content to keep point the blame on \cJuliet{them}.  If the humans found out you were to blame, it would not only make what the other air elementals were trying to do more difficult, but might also bar you from further research with the humans.  Still, you cannot get the image of the terrified human faces in the airplane windows out of your head.  The guilt weighs heavily on your conscience, but you remind yourself what one of your human scientist friends said, that science is not without risk, and you try to trust that \cKing{} knows what is best for all the air elementals.  However, something he had you help with recently sits more heavily on your conscience than the airplane incident.  The Air King, like most other high-ranking elementals, wants to increase his own faction's power and supress the other elements.  Usually, this has just led to petty squabbles, but this time you worry he is going too far.  With your help, he broke in to \cgrandDaughter{}'s lab with a captured low-ranking water elemental, and used the equipment to extract the very essence of the water.  What exactly he did with it you don't know, but you do know he somehow used it to create a substance used to poison the Earth King.
