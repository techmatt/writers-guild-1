For as long as you can remember, you have been curious.  Curious about the wind patterns on which you float, curious about the lives of other elementals, curious about this strange world in which you were born, and curious about the elemental plane in which you should have existed.  For nearly a century, you have travelled the world and seen its wonders, and yet there is still more to see and know.  Of course, being an air elemental does give you some advantages in being able to move around the world; you can float where the wind takes you, and the wind will invariable take you where you want to go.  You are loyal to your King, \cKing{\intro}, not entirely because you agree with his policies, but mostly because your life force is tied to his.

For most of your century-long life, you only dealt with \cKing{} in official settings.  While \cKing{} remained locked in a power struggle between the leaders of air, fire, water, and earth, you were much more interested in seeing the world and the strange human creatures that occupied it.  For decades, you were a careful naturalist, observing humans from afar, never interfering with their lives and only rarely being observed by them.  .  Recently, though, \cKing{} has taken an inexplicable interest in the fleshy species he had so long ignored.  You had already seen so much of the human world that you were \cKing{\their} natural first choice when \cKing{\they} needed someone to assist \cKing{\them} learn more about humans.  \cKing{\They} asked you to speak with the humans on his behalf, and you delighted in the opportunity to discover more about them, even if you have only been able to talk to a few, and only on official business.

You have been frequently meeting with \cDiplomat{\intro}, who, like you, has been given the task of communicating with the other side by \cDiplomat{\their} leader.  \cDiplomat{they} (is very awesome and you like them! and helps you learn about humans too)
%%will flesh out this paragraph more

That is how you found out about \cGD{\intro}.  \cGD{\Their} great-grandfather had researched the elemental plane, and it was his experiment that had brought the first group of elementals (including your King!) into the human world.

Of course, your studies have not always gone perfectly.  Recently, you were en route to report back to your King, when you saw two large metal birds in the air.  You decided to have a closer look.  They seemed not to be birds, but large, winged metal tubes, which had windows through which you could see human faces.  You paused for a moment, marveling at how these tiny, mundane humans had been able to nevertheless build a flying machine.  You watched the machines soar through the clear sky for a moment, and began to wonder if these human contraptions were carried by the winds in the same way Air elementals were. In your years as a naturalist, you had learned that elementals were not always careful to control of their powers and often humans would be hurt as a result.  You had been meticuluous in avoiding harming your research subjects.  But this time, you were just too curious. You began to manipulate the air currents, and watched the planes smoothly move up and down, side to side, for a time not noticing the look of panic that was overtaking the human faces inside.  It was only when you managed to make one machine roll over to see if it could fly upside-down that you realized you were taking things too far.  However, startled by your own realization that you might be hurting the little humans inside, you briefly stopped paying attention to what you were doing with the wind, and the two flying machines collided with a mighty explosion before hurtling into the ocean below.  You watched the water ripple out from the crash site and nearly flood a coastal village on a nearby volcanic island, before fleeing the scene in a panic to confessed all to \cKing{}.  \cKing{\They} at first did not understand why you were so upset, but eventually \cKing{\they} came to see that if the human leader found out you had crashed the airplanes, the \cKing{their} plan to pursue a treaty with the humans would likely be ruined.  \cKing{} suggested you blame \cJuliet{\intro}, a low-ranking fire elemental and fire's liason to air, and seems to also fire's liason to humans, who was travelling to the fire fortress inside the island's volcano that same day. \cJuliet{\they} could have come across the flying machines just as easily as you had.  There were enough flames in the crash, and fire elementals are responsible for a great deal of destruction to human buildings, so this story seems plausible enough, and should hold up as long as the humans have no way of uncovering other evidence against you.  

For now, you are content to keep point the blame on \cJuliet{}.  If the humans found out the crash was your fault, it would not only make what the other air elementals were trying to do more difficult, but might also bar you from further research with the humans.  \cDiplomat{} would most certainly not approve.  Still, you cannot get the image of the terrified human faces in the airplane windows out of your head.  The guilt weighs heavily on your conscience, but you try to trust that \cKing{} knows what is best for all the air elementals. Anyway, \cKing{\they} will keep your secret as long as you keep \cKing{theirs}...

In the incessant power struggle between elemental factions, \cKing{}.  Usually, this has just led to petty squabbles, but this time you worry he is going too far.  With your help, he broke in to \cGD{}'s lab with a captured low-ranking water elemental, and used the equipment to extract the water's essence.  What exactly he did with it afterwards you don't know, but you do know he somehow used it to create a substance used to poison the Earth King.  (BUT OH NO THERE ARE EARTH ELEMENTALS HERE WHAT IF THEY SUSPECT US TOO!)
