\name{\cMinion{}}

You are \cMinion{\intro}, a lowly earth elemental.

Your life was a happy one at first.  You broke off from your parent, and went happily about, merging with the earth, making earthquakes, swatting air elementals... you probably squished a couple of humans while you were at it, but they weren't important.

But the fun and games didn't last forever.  Everything started to slowly go wrong.  At first, you thought you had imagined the slow weakening of your strength.  Then, you were summoned into the presence of your king, \cEarthKing{}.  \cEarthKing{\They} had also experienced this loss of power, as had every other elemental in the room.  You were appropriately horrified.  \cEarthKing{} explained that it was likely that the lack of \iWhite{}, once provided by the quintessence elementals, was to blame.  Since no quintessence had some through the Conduit long ago, there was no \iWhite{}.  And, without \iWhite{}, \cEarthKing{} thought it likely that all elementals would eventually weaken and die.

But, you, along with other elementals including \cLoyal{} and \cRogue{}, were assigned the task of resolving the problem.  Ten years ago, you visited the human structure where the Conduit had been opened before.  You snatched a convenient human along the way, to be a vessel for the incoming quintessence, the way humans had been used to bring in the other elementals a hundred years before.  With the others, you activated the human tools you thought would open the Conduit and bring a quintessence elemental through.

You broke some of the stuff.  Human instruments are so delicate!  But... something seemed to work.  Sort of.  There were wiggles on the screen you were watching, but you looked away at just the right moment, to see, for a single moment, a bright white glow around the human.  But then something broke.  The human collapsed, and there was no other elemental in the room.  All the others decided that they must have failed.  You wanted to stay and investigate further, but they made you leave with them.

You, on the other hand, are convinced that a quintessence elemental came through.  And, if the human you left behind actually survived the process, the quintessence elemental may be hiding out in that person.  You have explained this repeatedly to the other elementals, but without evidence, they don't believe you.  It's almost to the point where if you bring up the subject, they'll enslave you to make you shut up.  Now that you're returning to where the Conduit is, maybe you can find some actual evidence.  Or, even better, maybe the quintessence elemental will come back, trying to find a way home.

That experiment ten years ago wasn't the only strange thing that's happened to you.  Three years ago, you were making some nice, comfy tremors when a human interrupted you.  And {\em enslaved} you, for a little while.

At this elemental gathering near the Conduit, you and \cLoyal{} are supposed to be bring through enough quintessence elementals to establish order and give everyone enough \iWhite{} to survive.  But you've got a better idea.

The long list of problems doesn't even stop there.  To top it all off, 

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Find that quintessence elemental that came through ten years ago.  You're sure it has to be here, somewhere.
	\item Find a way to heal \cEarthKing{}.
	\item Find a way to enslave quintessence elementals.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cLoyal{}}  The top-ranked elemental standing in for \cEarthKing{} at this gathering.
	\contact{\cRogue{}}  A second-tier elemental who has broken with the hierarchy.
	\contact{\cMS{}}  A human scientist studying elemental enslavement.
\end{contacts}
