You are a quintessence elemental, a happy, white, glowy ball of quintessence.  You're very young, and very new at all of this being-an-elemental thing, and at keeping all the other types of elementals from fighting each other.  Your parent doesn't let you handle anything but the smallest spats between small elementals.

And then you heard a song.  It was pretty and enticing, and you got sucked through a door... into this weird place.

There are elementals here that are too big for you to control.  You're quintessence -- so most of the other elementals can't enslave you.  But you worry that they might threaten to hurt you unless you help them with something, or give them the healing substance \iWhiteQ{} that you can make.  And what are these other things that aren't elementals?

Your CR is 3 for the purpose of normal combat. For the purpose of enslaving others and resisting enslavement, your CR is 6 (see ``The Elemental Enslavement Mechanic'' greensheet and your corresponding enslavement ability).

You start the game immediately after having left the elemental plane and arriving on this alien world. The connection which brought you here promptly seals shut behind you.
