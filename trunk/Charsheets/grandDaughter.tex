You are \cGD{\intro}. To your friends, you are a capable scientist in your own right. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the human population knows you not as a researcher, but only as the granddaughter of the infamous Konrad Strauss, the eccentric scientist who was responsible for humanity's first encounter with the elementals one hundred years ago. Although your grandfather died before you were born, you have always admired his work. While Konrad has often been vilified as mad and dangerous, you have every intention of building upon his work and using this knowledge to fix ``the elemental problem''.

A considerable amount of your work focuses on the mysterious connection between Earth and the elemental planes, which the elementals refer to as the Conduit. This connection was first established in the incident 100 years ago in your grandfather's lab, but for most of the time remains dormant and closed. But from your studies, you have determined that approximately every 10 years, Earth and the elemental planes again become close enough that a connection can be formed. During this period, the Conduit emits a particular harmonic field that for reasons you do not yet fully understand, seems to pacify or otherwise weaken elementals who come near it. You have also learned that this connection between Earth and the elemental planes is incredibly dangerous -- continued use of the Conduit is almost certain to cause unrepairable damage the fabric of space with ramifications you wouldn't even dare to guess.

Your research has shown another trend that is both disturbing and interesting: the elementals appear to be getting weaker. It's not very noticeable on small time scales, but their powers are definitely subtly diminishing. As far as you can tell, something important to the functioning of elementals is simply not present on Earth. According to your projections, they may reach a critical point anywhere between 50 to 100 years from now. Without a more rigorous study with willing elemental participants you can't be sure, but you also believe that the elementals whose powers start to rapidly fade are likely to exhibit extremely unstable and erratic behavior (even for elementals). The potential devastation they could cause in such a state is enormous. This steady decline is not something that is widely agreed upon or has been well publicized, but you have compiled some documents that you feel could prove it to any rationally-minded individual.

Realizing the dangers caused by use of the Conduit and the presence of the elementals in general, over a decade ago you decided that there is only one safe course of action: you must send all the elementals back home and seal the Conduit forever. This is no easy task, but you are confident it is possible. For some time now, you have been developing a device that has the potential to function as a super-powered electromagnet that is attuned to elemental beings. Although there is no accessible source of power on Earth big enough for your electromagnet to run at full capacity, you have designed it so that it can use the connection to the elemental planes and the strange field emitted by the Conduit to draw enough current to operate on a truly global scale. In theory, it has the potential to use the power provided by the Conduit to pull the vast majority of the elementals to it and channel them back to the elemental plane. In practice, you are not quite certain such a thing is even possible, and you have been working tirelessly to overcome the considerable engineering challenges needed to make the device work. Given the implications of your project and the likely violent reception it would receive from the elemental factions, you have also not been overly vocal with describing it to others.

Given its geographical significance, a natural place for you to conduct your research is your grandfather's laboratory. Twelve years ago, you began restoring Konrad's lab space and moving key parts of your own research equipment there, preparing to gather key experimental data from the next Conduit opening. This was going quite well indeed and preparations were complete, until the day before the Conduit opening ten years ago. On that day, a pack of relatively high-tier earth elementals showed up accompanied by a small number of possibly enslaved or at least captive humans. Wisely realizing the need for caution, you fled the premises before they could notice you. To your dismay, you watched from a distance as they attempted a limited opening of the Conduit using your infrastructure then left shortly afterwards. Returning to your lab, you were infuriated to see the damage they had wrecked to your equipment. You still managed to salvage some data, and your logs showed that \emph{something} transferred through the Conduit, although it wasn't too large and you don't really know what it was. Most of the lab had been indiscriminately smashed by the earth brutes who don't realize how sensitive scientific equipment can be. You decided to take what you could salvage back to safer human-controlled territory and haven't been back to your grandfather's lab in ten years; but in all that time you still haven't exactly forgiven the earth elementals for the damage they caused and the recklessness with which they opened something as dangerous as a conduit between two planes of existence. You also intend to find out exactly what they were trying to accomplish and what they moved through the connection.

You take your science very seriously. Especially in a day and age when humanity is stretched thin, there have been quite a number of horror stories involving scientists who went beyond the bounds of acceptability to accomplish their goals. The worst of these involve using unwilling human subjects, or conducting research that isn't absolutely safe resulting in disfigurement, dismemberment, or even death. It is very, very important to you that science be perceived in a positive light and that those who conduct such research hold themselves to uncompromisingly strict ethical codes to make up for the damage already done. You have trouble containing your hatred for anyone who is not appropriately cautious when dealing with dangerous areas of scientific research, and if you were to ever discover a scientists \emph{intentionally} risked someone's life in the name of scientific progress, you would have to restrain yourself from murdering them. At the very least, you would see them publicly exposed and prosecuted, with their lab and funding disbanded forever. You are very watchful of the scientists who you work with, and given your growing prominence within the scientific community and your complicated person history, most of those you interact with are quite cautious indeed.
