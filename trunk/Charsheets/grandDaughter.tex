You are \cGD{\intro}. To your friends, you are a capable scientist in your own right. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the human population knows you not as a researcher, but only as the great granddaughter of the infamous Konrad Strauss, the eccentric scientist who was responsible for humanity's first encounter with the elementals one hundred years ago. Although your grandfather died before you were born, you have always admired his work. While Konrad has often been vilified as mad and dangerous, you have every intention of building upon his work and using this knowledge to fix ``the elemental problem''.

A considerable amount of your work focuses on the mysterious connection between Earth and the elemental planes, which the elementals refer to as the Conduit. This connection was first established in the incident 100 years ago in your grandfather's lab, but for most of the time remains dormant and closed. But from your studies, you have determined that approximately every 10 years, Earth and the elemental planes again become close enough that a connection can be formed. During this period, the Conduit emits a particular harmonic field that for reasons you do not yet fully understand, seems to pacify or otherwise weaken elementals who come near it. You have also learned that this connection between Earth and the elemental planes is incredibly dangerous -- continued use of the Conduit is almost certain to cause unrepairable damage the fabric of space with ramifications you wouldn't even dare to guess.

Your research has also shown another trend that is both disturbing and interesting: the elementals appear to be getting weaker. It's not very noticeable on small time scales, but their powers are definitely diminishing. As far as you can tell, something important to the functioning of elementals is simply not present on Earth. According to your projections, they may reach a critical point anywhere between 50 to 100 years from now. Without a more rigorous study with willing elemental participants you can't be sure, but you also believe that the elementals whose powers start to rapidly fade are likely to exhibit extremely unstable and erratic behavior (even for elementals). The potential devastation they could cause in such a state is enormous. This steady decline is not something that is widely agreed upon or has been well publicized, but 

Realizing the dangers caused by use of the Conduit and the presence of the Elementals in general, over a decade ago you decided that there is only one safe course of action: you must send all the elementals back home and seal the Conduit forever. This is no easy task, but you are confident it is possible. For some time now, you have been developing a device you are called the electromagnet.

Azi.

Elementals are getting weaker.
