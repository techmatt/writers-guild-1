You are \cGD{\intro}. To your friends, you are an accomplished scientist. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the human population knows you not as a researcher, but only as the great granddaughter of the infamous Konrad Strauss, the eccentric scientist who was responsible for humanity's first encounter with the elementals one hundred years ago. You have always admired your grandfather's work despite the trouble it has caused. While Konrad has often been vilified as mad and dangerous, you have every intention of building upon his work and using this knowledge to fix ``the elemental problem''.

%Several years after the incident, your grandfather was murdered by an Azi who was forcibly re-taped by a criminal who was never caught. 

A considerable amount of your research focuses on the mysterious connection between Earth and the elemental planes, which the elementals refer to as the Conduit. This connection was first established in the incident 100 years ago in your grandfather's lab, but for most of the time it remains dormant and closed. But from your studies, you have determined that approximately every 10 years Earth and the elemental planes again become close enough that a connection can be formed. During this period, the Conduit emits a particular harmonic field that for reasons you do not yet fully understand, seems to pacify or otherwise weaken elementals who come near it. You have also learned that this connection between Earth and the elemental planes is incredibly dangerous -- continued use of the Conduit is almost certain to cause unrepairable damage the fabric of space with ramifications you wouldn't even dare to guess.

Your research has shown another trend that is both disturbing and interesting: the elementals appear to be getting weaker. It's not very noticeable on small time scales, but their powers are definitely subtly diminishing. As far as you can tell, something important to the functioning of elementals is simply not present on Earth. According to your projections, they may reach a critical point anywhere between 50 to 100 years from now. Without a more rigorous study with willing elemental participants you can't be sure, but you also believe that the elementals whose powers start to rapidly fade are likely to exhibit extremely unstable and erratic behavior (even for elementals). The potential devastation they could cause in such a state is enormous. This steady decline is not something that is widely agreed upon or has been well publicized, but you have compiled some documents that you feel could prove it to any rationally-minded individual.

Realizing the dangers caused by use of the Conduit and the presence of the elementals in general, over a decade ago you decided that there is only one safe course of action: you must send all the elementals back home and seal the Conduit forever. This is no easy task, but you are confident it is possible. For some time now, you have been developing a device that has the potential to function as a super-powered electromagnet that is attuned to elemental beings. Although there is no accessible source of power on Earth big enough for your electromagnet to run at full capacity, you have designed it so that it can use the connection to the elemental planes and the strange field emitted by the Conduit to draw enough current to operate on a truly global scale. In theory, it has the potential to use the power provided by the Conduit to pull the vast majority of the elementals to it and channel them back to the elemental plane. In practice, you are not quite certain such a thing will work, but you have been working tirelessly to overcome the considerable engineering challenges needed to make the device function correctly. Considering the implications of your project and the likely violent reception it would receive from the elemental factions, you have also not been overly vocal with describing it to others.

Given its geographical significance, a natural place for you to conduct your research is your grandfather's laboratory. Twelve years ago, you began restoring Konrad's lab space and moving key parts of your own research equipment there, preparing to gather key experimental data from the next Conduit opening. This was going quite well indeed and preparations were complete, until the day before the Conduit opening ten years ago. On that day, a pack of relatively high-tier earth elementals showed up accompanied by a small number of captive humans. Wisely realizing the need for caution, you fled the premises before they could notice you. To your dismay, you watched from a distance as they attempted a limited opening of the Conduit using your infrastructure. They left shortly afterwards. Returning to your lab, you were infuriated to see the damage they had wrecked to your equipment. You still managed to salvage some data, and your logs showed that \emph{something} transferred through the Conduit, although you don't really know what it was or even which direction it was traveling in. You decided to take what you could salvage back to safer human-controlled territory and haven't been back to your grandfather's lab in ten years; but in all that time you still haven't exactly forgiven the earth elementals for the damage they caused and the recklessness with which they opened something as dangerous as a conduit between two planes of existence. You also intend to find out exactly what they were trying to accomplish and what they moved through the connection.

You take your science very seriously. Especially in a day and age when humanity is stretched thin, there have been quite a number of horror stories involving scientists who went beyond the bounds of acceptability to accomplish their goals. The worst of these involve using unwilling human subjects, forcibly retaping Azi, or conducting research that isn't absolutely safe resulting in disfigurement, dismemberment, or even death. It is very, very important to you that science be perceived in a positive light and that those who conduct such research hold themselves to uncompromisingly strict ethical codes to make up for the damage already done. You have trouble containing your hatred for anyone who is not appropriately cautious when dealing with dangerous areas of scientific research, and if you were to ever discover that a scientists \emph{intentionally} risked someone's life in the name of scientific progress, you would have to restrain yourself from murdering them. At the very least, you would see them publicly exposed, prosecuted, and imprisoned, with their lab and funding disbanded forever. You are very watchful of the scientists who you work with, and given your growing prominence within the scientific community and your complicated person history, most of those you interact with are quite cautious indeed.

%Given your grandfather's murder, even the thought that a scientist might conduct a rapid retaping of an Azi gets your blood boiling. 

Three months ago, you had a very unsettling experience. One minute you were sitting in your lab, working on your electromagnet. Twenty minutes later, you were recovering on the floor in a pool of water. Doing a quick MRI, you discovered that your brain had the residual effects associated with the elemental's absurd mental control ability. While it's true elementals occasionally enslave humans who wander away from protected human encampments, for them to sneak into a human facility and so selectively target a single human is practically unprecedented. Even more mysteriously, upon investigating the pool of water on the ground, it appears to belong to a \emph{wounded} water elemental. After extensive investigation, your best guess is that for reasons unknown to you, one of the other elemental factions used your electromagnet to wound, restrain, or otherwise affect a restrained water elemental. There were small signs of a struggle, but it's not clear if the water elemental managed to break free or was dragged away. Either way, you reported the incident to \cDiplomat{\intro}, an Azi diplomat who you have found to be quite capable and trustworthy. Nonetheless, none of the elemental factions have claimed responsibility and at present, the incident remains a disturbing mystery.

Given your research experience, you were a natural choice to be on the team returning to the Conduit site. Considering the dangers involved, you are extremely concerned that elementals are taking such interest in the site and are determined to make sure that both elementals and humans realize just how serious things are and what could happen if the situation is not handled with extreme caution. You don't really know what to think of the elementals, but it could be exciting to have closer conversations with them; given their physical prowess and mental enslavement abilities, most humans including yourself rarely have the opportunity to interact with elementals closely. But more than anything, you are immensely nervous: you have been testing your electromagnet device for many, many years and have been preparing for exactly this day. In a few hours, if things go as you have been planned, tomorrow is going to be a much, much better day for humans.

%does GD have a mempacket regarding rogue/loyalist, who she saw trashing her lab?

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Restore your family's good name by completing and activating your electromagnet to send all the elementals back through the Conduit.
  \item Find others who realize your plan is the best course of action and convince them to help you. %this is its own goal because getting ``popular support'' for your plan is important, ideally she doesn't want it to just come out of the blue.
  \item If you can't send the elementals back, instead try to seal the Conduit to prevent a future catastrophe.
  \item Figure out why the elementals are dying. Discuss this problem with the human diplomats to see how the elementals might react to the news.
  \item Find out what the earth elementals did at the Conduit ten years ago.
  \item Find out what happened in your lab three months ago.
  \item Investigate all other scientists to make sure they are conforming to ethical standards. Bring all ethical violations to the attention of the leading government officials.

\begin{contacts}
%These are longer descriptions than a contact list should be -- I'm working on incorporating this text into the main body.
  \contact{\cLeader{}} The elected leader of the majority of humanity. Reasonably charismatic, and respectful enough. More importantly, \cLeader{\they} doesn't try to directly interfere with scientific research or push it faster than it is safe to do so. Although it is not an official capacity, you occasionally act as a sort of science advisor, and bring scientific matters that are politically sensitive to \cLeader{\their} attention. You are not sure how receptive \cLeader{\they} will be to your plans for the elementals, but you hope to bring \cLeader{\them} on board, if you can.
	\contact{\cDema{}} An unpleasant politician. \cDema{\They} is always pushing for more aggressive and dangerous research, and you fear that if \cDema{\they} had \cDema{\their} way, there would be no checks on the types of experiments that would be carried out in the name of military progress. Fortunately, \cDema{\they} has little influence over what types of research actually gets done, and if you have anything to say on the matter, it will stay that way.
	\contact{\cMS{}} Definitely a brilliant scientist, but also an extremely troublesome individual and a terrible collaborator. \cMS{\They} cares far too much about how others perceive \cMS{\them}, and although \cMS{\they} may make a good show of following standard ethical procedures, you are quite confident that without oversight, \cMS{\they} would ignore such issues entirely. \cMS{\They} is always a vocal supporter of \cDema{}'s views on scientific research. You are not really certain what \cMS{\they} is up to at the Conduit, but you suspect it is probably both reckless and dangerous. Specializes in understanding the mechanisms by which elementals can exert mental control over both their own species and humans.
	\contact{\cScientist{}} An Azi scientist who you quite enjoy working with. Personable, intelligent, and very focused. Like most Azi, \cScientist{\they} also understands the need for not allowing political pressure to interfere with doing science properly and safely. You do not know exactly what \cScientist{\they} is working on at present, but \cScientist{\their} specialty is elemental chemistry and you have had good experiences working together in the past.
  \contact{\cAvatar{}} TODO: Read the avatar's character sheet. I feel that having him/her as a contact is important because she's the one with the best chance of figuring out what's going on with the Avatar.
