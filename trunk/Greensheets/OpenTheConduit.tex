\name{\gConduit{}}

The conduit may be opened by a single person. Read the entire sheet before beginning the process. A GM must be present before step 2 begins.


If you would like to open the conduit, you must follow these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Locate the current point of closest contact.
  \item Consume 1 battery (tear up the item card)
  \item Declare {\bf loudly} that you are opening the conduit. (Someone around the corner should be able to hear you)
  \item Place your ability card ``\aWorkConduit{}'' on the ``\gConduitModifier{}'' sheet.
  \item {\bf If any modifications are desired, they must be placed on the ``\gConduitModifier{}'' sheet at this time as well. ALL ABILITIES MUST BE VISIBLE. Otherwise nothing will happen when the conduit is opened.}
  \item Spend 5 minutes opening the conduit. Anyone with abilities on ``\gConduitModifier{}'' must also devote these 5 minutes to opening the conduit with their desired modification.
  \item The GM will reveal what happens.
\end{enumerate}

Important notes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Anyone who is not involved in opening the conduit or modifying the process in some way can walk up and observe the abilities being used. (\emph{This is a phys-rep for these actions being obvious}).
  \item A person involved in opening or modifying the conduit may withdraw at any time by removing their ability card from the ``\gConduitModifier{}'' sheet. However, if they do so, any effects of the ability will not occur.
  \item Opening the conduit as well as all modifications are all {\bf separately} interruptible. This means that someone can interrupt a modification without preventing the conduit from opening. HOWEVER, interrupting the process of opening the conduit will prevent all modfiers from taking effect.
\end{itemize}
