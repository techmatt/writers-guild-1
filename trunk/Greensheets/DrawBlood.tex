\name{\gDrawBlood{}} 

This greensheet explains how to draw blood from someone.

In order to draw blood:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Acquire ``\iVial{}'' (item number: \iVial{\MYnumber{}}) and ``\iSyringe{}'' (item number: \iSyringe{\MYnumber{}}). 
\item Take 30 seconds to draw blood from a {\bf willing or helpless target (restrained or unconscious)}. You may also take up to 2 vials of blood from a wounded person. (The person takes no CR penalty). You may not take blood from a dead player - their life essence is gone and the blood is useless to you.
\item Write on the vial card that it contains human or elemental blood and from what faction (for elementals). 
\end{enumerate}

NOTE: The first time you draw blood from someone, the person takes a -1 to CR for 3 minutes. The second time you draw blood, they suffer a -2 to CR for 3 minutes, etc. {\bf You must tell your target their CR loss.} the CR of a player cannot drop below 1 from this ability
