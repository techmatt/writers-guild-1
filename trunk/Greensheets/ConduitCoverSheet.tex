%%Cart goes Beep Beep

The machine is fairly complex and can do several things if you have the right ability. Anyone can ``Locate The Point of Closest Contact'' but only those with the right knowledge can use this device to actually open a conduit to the Elemental plane.

NOTE: This machine is big, heavy and unwieldy. It is 3-hands bulky (one person may move it by walking heel to toe, two people may move it walking normally). If you move this machine, you must indicate that the machine is moving by saying ``Beep beep'' continuously. We wouldn't want to run someone over with it.\\


{\large How to Locate The Point of Closest Contact:}

This machine can locate where the Conduit can be opened. While it is known that the point of closest contact is in this general vicinity, the exact location remains unknown. To further complicate matters, the point of closest contact may move throughout the day as the planes approach each other.

In order to establish the point of closest contact (and thus the place where the conduit can currently be opened) you must follow these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Maneuver this machine to be directly in front of ``\sLocationCoverSheet{}'' Sign. ({\bf The sign may not read: ``\sSealedLocationSheet{}''.})
  \item Two people must put both hands on the machine for {\bf 5} seconds to indicate that you are using it to analyze the location.
  \item Once step 2 is complete, you may lift the ``\sLocationCoverSheet{}'' sign to check the sign under it. The sign will state when the location is active.
  \item When you are done reviewing the chart, you must cover it again with the ``\sLocationCoverSheet{}'' sign. If you need to check a location again, you must repeat this process from step 1, you can't just check the bottom page.
\end{enumerate}
