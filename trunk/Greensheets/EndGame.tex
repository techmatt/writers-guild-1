\emph{This sheet summarizes the various ``end of game'' scenarios.}

\subsection{Elementals get sent home}

If \cGD{\intro} successfully hooks up the electromagnet to a terminal opening, some of the elementals get sent home. How many depends on how many elemental essence \cGD{} used. One essence will only get those in game space, which will have similar effects to the ``an elemental leader dies'' scenario. Three essence gets a much larger radius including the earth king, but the water queen persists and forms an agreement of sorts with the humans (balance is managed because now there's only one serious faction left). Five or more essence sends all the elementals home (the number of essence needed may be adjusted depending on how things play out).

\subsection{One or more of the elemental leaders die}

The loss of a leader is a serious problem. That elemental faction will rapidly implode and be crushed by the opposing faction. Regardless of alliances, a lot of strife will ensue as the competing faction (for example, water queen taking advantage of fire queen's death) proceeds to wipe out the leaderless faction. Many humans and elementals will die on all sides.

\textbf{Elementals acquire a large source of Elementium}

If \cScientist{\intro} uses an ability on a terminal opening of the Conduit, a large quantity of Elementium will be brought over.
