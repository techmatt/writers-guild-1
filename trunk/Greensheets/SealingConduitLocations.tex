In the name of maintaining your advantage on this plane, you intend to prevent anyone from opening the Conduit tonight.  To do this, you will have to seal the possible Conduit locations. This also leads to your ultimate goal of sealing the Conduit permanently. To seal the Conduit locations, you will need to draw a Rune of Sealing across the location with a fascinating human substance you have encountered called ``Loc-Tite''. It takes the form of \iLockTight{}.

To seal a Conduit location:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Acquire \iLockTight{}.
  \item Spend 5 minutes sealing a conduit location. This is an interruptible action. You must tell onlookers that you are spreading purple goo over the entire area, and that your action can be interrupted.
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Humans and elementals can help you! For each person that assists you, cut 1 minute from the time required to seal the location, to a minimum of 1 minute. (If 5 people assist you, it will still take 1 minute)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Stick a ``\sSealedLocationSheet{}'' sign on top of the ``\sLocationCoverSheet{}'' sheet.
\end{enumerate}

Unfortunately, this seal is not permanent until it sets in 5 hours. Until then, someone could wash the sealant off. You will have to keep an eye on it.

{\large \emph{If 8 of the possible locations are sealed at the end of game, the Conduit will be sealed permanently and can never be opened again.}}
