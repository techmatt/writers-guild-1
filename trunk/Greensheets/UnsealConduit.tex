\name{\gUnsealConduit{}} 

You have spent entirely too much of your life cleaning up after elementals. You are therefore well versed in how to clean almost anything elemental-related off almost any surface. In particular, you are familiar with a method for removing compounds used to seal things. 

If you would like to clean a seal off a possible conduit location, you must: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Acquire a \iBowl{}, and fill it with water from the pond, stream or sink. (This will take you 1 minute).
\item Acquire a \iLye{}. \emph{These items will come to a total of 3 hands bulky, so you will either need help or you will need to  walk heel to toe to your location.} 
\item Then spend 2 minutes cleaning the seal off. Role play accordingly.
\end{enumerate}
